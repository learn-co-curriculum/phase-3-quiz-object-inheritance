# Object Inheritance: Fundamentals

```
class Computer
  attr_accessor :name, :ram, :hd

  def initialize(name, ram, hd)
    @name = name
    @ram_amount = ram
    @hd_size = hd
  end

  def calculate
    "Crunching numbers!"
  end
end
```

To overwrite an inherited method from&nbsp;`Computer`, which syntax should be
used?

## Correct

```
class Laptop < Computer
  def calculate
    "Processing mathematics!"
  end
end
```

> Perfect! We declare the method with the same name inside the subclass and then
> write our code.

## Incorrect

```
class Computer::Laptop
  def calculate
    "Processing mathematics!"
  end
end
```

> Not quite. The double colon signifies namespacing, i.e. a module or class called
> Laptop would be declared inside of a module or class called Computer. This is
> different from inheritance.

## Incorrect

```
class Laptop
  def calculate
    "Processing mathematics!"
  end
end
```

> Laptop is being declared, but it isn't inheriting from a parent class. How do we
> fix this?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
