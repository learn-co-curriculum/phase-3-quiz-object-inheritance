# Object Inheritance: Modules

We want to declare a method on a subclass that has the same name as one that's declared on the parent class. The subclass's method should add to the parent class's functionality, rather than completely overwrite it. How do we do this?

## Correct

Use `super` in the subclass's method

> Correct! We can call `super` anywhere we want in the method to call the parent's
> method.

## Incorrect

Use `extend` in the subclass's method

> Not quite. We use `extend` to mix in class methods from a module. You might want
> to review the resource/s for this question.

## Incorrect

Use `include` in the subclass's method

> Not quite. We use `include` to mix in instance methods from a module. You might
> want to review the resource/s for this question.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
