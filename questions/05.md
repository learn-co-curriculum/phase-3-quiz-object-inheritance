# Object Inheritance: Modules

Consider the following code:

```rb
class DailyRoutine
  def morning
    puts "coffee"
    puts "shower"
  end
end

class MondayRoutine < DailyRoutine
  def morning
    puts "jog"
    puts "coffee"
    puts "shower"
  end
end
```

We want the `morning` method in the `MondayRoutine` class to add to the parent
class's functionality, rather than completely overwrite it. How do we do this in
a way that doesn't duplicate so much code?

## Correct

Use `super` in `MondayRoutine#morning` method.

> Correct! We can call `super` anywhere we want in the method to call the
> parent's method, like so:
>
> ```rb
> class MondayRoutine < DailyRoutine
>   def morning
>     puts "jog"
>     super
>   end
> end
> ```

## Incorrect

Use `extend` in the `MondayRoutine` class.

> Not quite. We use `extend` to mix in class methods from a module. You might
> want to review the resource/s for this question.

## Incorrect

Use `include` in the `MondayRoutine` class.

> Not quite. We use `include` to mix in instance methods from a module. You
> might want to review the resource/s for this question.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
