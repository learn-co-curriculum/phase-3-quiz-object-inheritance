# Object Inheritance: Modules

Consider the following code:

```
module Phrase
  def hello
    "Hello!"
  end

  def goodbye
    "Good bye!"
  end
end

class Parrot
  include Phrase

  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Human
  include Phrase

  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

The inheritance shown in the code above is an example of what?

## Correct

Using methods from a module as instance methods

> Fantastic! The `include` keyword allows us to use the methods from the `Phrase`
> module in the `Parrot` and `Human` classes as instance methods.

## Incorrect

Subclass inheritance

> Not quite. Take a look at how `Parrot` and `Human` are declared. Does that look
> like the same syntax used for inheritance?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.

## Incorrect

Using methods from a module as class methods

> Not quite. To use methods from a module as **class** methods, use the `extend`
> keyword, not `include`.
