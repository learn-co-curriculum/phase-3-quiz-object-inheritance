# Object Inheritance: Fundamentals

We have a `Computer` class and would like to declare `Laptop` as a subclass of
`Computer`. Which syntax should we use?

## Correct

```rb
class Laptop < Computer

end
```

> Yes! We use the _less than_ symbol followed by the name of the parent class to
> specify that `Laptop` inherits from `Computer`.

## Incorrect

```rb
class Computer > Laptop

end
```

> Not quite, but close. Try to think of it this way: which class is adding its
> properties to the subclass (child class)? Now, which way should the arrow
> point?

## Incorrect

```rb
class Laptop

end
```

> This code declares the Laptop class but it doesn't cause the Laptop class to
> inherit from Computer. How can we make that happen? What's missing?

## Incorrect

```rb
class Computer < Laptop

end
```

> This would actually declare the `Computer` class and cause it to inherit from
> `Laptop`. How can we declare the `Laptop` class and make it inherit from
> `Computer` instead?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
