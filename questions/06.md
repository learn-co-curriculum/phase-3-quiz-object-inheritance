# Object Inheritance: Super

```
class Furniture
  def build
    puts "Your furniture is being built"
  end
end
```

We have a parent class `Furniture` and a subclass `Table`. In the `Table` class,
we want to be able to call `#build` and have it print "You have chosen a table"
followed by "Your furniture is being built". Which code block achieves this?
Choose the **best** option.

## Correct

```
class Table < Furniture
  def build
    puts "You have chosen a table"
    super
  end
end
```

> Yes! If Table inherits from Furniture we can supercharge the `#build` method by
> calling `super` after running whatever extra functionality we need to run first.

## Incorrect

```
class Table < Furniture
  def build
    super
    puts "You have chosen a table"
  end
end
```

> Almost. In which order will the strings print? How can we make them print in the
> correct order?

## Incorrect

```
class Table
  def build
    puts "You have chosen a table"
    puts "Your furniture is being built"
  end
end
```

> Not quite. While this will achieve what we want, we have repeated ourselves.
> What can we do instead to DRY up our code and ensure the strings print in the
> correct order?

## Incorrect

```
class Table < Furniture
  def build
    puts "You have chosen a table"
    puts "Your furniture is being built"
  end
end
```

> Not quite. While this will achieve what we want, we have repeated ourselves and
> we've also overwritten the parent's method. What can we do instead to DRY up our
> code and ensure the strings print in the correct order?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
